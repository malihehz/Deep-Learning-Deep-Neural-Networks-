# Deep-Learning
 The Keras and Tensorflow libraries are two of the most commonly used tools in deep learning. In this repository, the fully-connected (dense) neural networks implemented on the Gamma ray and solar x-ray datasets and convolutional neural networks implemented on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to image processing. Algorithm performance increased using Regularizers (L1, L2, dropout), Normalization (batch normalization), Optimizer and initial parameters (earning rate, momentum), Dense layers (number and size), Convolutional layers (number of filters, size of convolutional filters, stride), Pooling layers, Activation functions (relu, elu, sigmoid), Initializers (Glorot and He), Batch size, Data augmentation, Epochs.
