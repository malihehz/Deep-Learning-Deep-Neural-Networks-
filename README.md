# Deep-Learning
 The Keras and Tensorflow libraries are two of the most commonly used tools in deep learning. In this repository, the fully-connected (dense) neural networks implemented on the Gamma ray and solar x-ray datasets and convolutional neural networks implemented on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to image processing.
